# Data cleaning in SQL
In the Nashville Housing Sales Data Cleaning project, I cleaned a public database on Nashville house sales. I used MS SQL Server to execute queries that standardized dates, populated missing data, split data into new columns, removed duplicates, and removed unnecessary columns.
## Table of contents
1. Setup
3. Standardize Date Format by converting them to "Date" type
4. Fill in the Missing Property Address data
5. Splitting Address into Individual Columns (Address, City, State)
6. Change Y and N to Yes and No in "Sold AS Vacant" field
7. Find duplicate rows
